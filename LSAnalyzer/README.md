# ToDo-List
* add two-level regression (with/without assumption of sorted cluster variable) 
* dataset types:
	* allow semi-colon separated list of weights in dataset type config and add ability to choose one when selecting analysis file
	* allow optional plausible values that may or may not be present in data file, thereby enabling more general dataset types
	* expand the list of default dataset types
* variable names/labels:
	* use variable labels (if provided in data file) in request analysis UI
	* implement variable display name to hide away regex in PVs
* think of a way of storing analysis requests and applying them again if possible
